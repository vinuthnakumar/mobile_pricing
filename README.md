# Mobile Price Range Prediction

This repository contains a simple machine learning project to predict the price range of mobile phones based on various features. The project uses a Random Forest Classifier for classification.

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: The main Python script containing the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation logic.
* `data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model. (A sample is provided for demonstration, but you can replace it with your own data.)

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
